Thank you for downloading RamenOS
The only officially supported platform is Windows, though it will probably work on others too.

Install Python 3.8.5
Open the Windows Command Prompt
cd to the location of RamenOS.py
Type "RamenOS.py"
You have now run RamenOS.

Or, to view the code:
Open in notepad. It's pretty simple.
